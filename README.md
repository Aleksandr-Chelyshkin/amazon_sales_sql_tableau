## The insights visualized through the interactive Tableau [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aleksandr.chelyshkin/viz/Amazon_Sales_17082940665600/Dashboard1).
This repository contains the scripts and analysis related to my exploration of the Amazon sales dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/unlock-profits-with-e-commerce-sales-data). 

The project delves into various aspects of
* Product Performance
* Customer behavior
* Geographical trends

**Objective:**

* To extract any valuable insights from Amazon sales data to inform data-driven business decisions.
* To understand customer buying habits, top-selling products, and regional sales patterns.
* To leverage these insights to optimize inventory management & marketing strategies.

**Key Findings:**

* Set and Kurta are the top-selling product categories based on quantity sold & sales.
* The 4th month (April) appears to be the most profitable in terms of revenue.
* The Set category with size "M" consistently emerges as the top-selling product across the months (March to June).
* The return rate is approximately 1.54%, indicating a relatively low return frequency, however, there's a substantial cancellation rate.
* The cancellation rate is notably higher at around 14.28%, suggesting a considerable proportion of orders are cancelled before fulfillment.
* MAHARASHTRA: Emerges as the top performer with a total sales amount of 13,335,534.14 INR, indicating significant economic activity and consumer demand within the state, particularly in cities like Mumbai.
* BENGALURU: Leads the list with total sales amounting to 6,849,664.99 INR, indicating significant economic activity and consumer spending in the city. This suggests Bengaluru's strong market presence and potential as a hub for commerce and business activities.
